# Maze-Solver-Robot-Algorithm---C-Arduino
This algorithm detects the various nodes in a maze formed with black lines using a line follower robot and then computes the best path for minimum turns from start to end point.
The embeded c code is in Arduino languge and cam be directly dumped to any arduino software
